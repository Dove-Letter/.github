# Dove Letter

Dove Letter is a private subscription repository ([dove-letter](https://github.com/Dove-Letter/dove-letter)) where you can learn, discuss, and share new knowledge about Android and Kotlin. You can stay updated with the latest information through articles and references, tips with code samples that demonstrate best practices, updates from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), new releases, and news about the overall Android/Kotlin ecosystem. Unlike a typical news or weekly letter, it provides useful tips and information irregularly but frequently from the repository manager, [Jaewoong Eum (skydoves)](https://github.com/skydoves/).

## Learn the Latest News and Knowledge About Android & Kotlin
By subscribing to this repository, you'll stay updated with the latest release news, trending topics in the community, useful tools, open-source projects, and practical tips with code samples. This subscription is ideal for anyone eager to learn and stay informed about the Android/Kotlin ecosystems.

## Explore All Histories

All commits and news are summarized and archived every 1-4 weeks into the repository with GitHub releases based on the amount of material rather than a fixed schedule. You can explore all histories in markdown format on the GitHub repository.

## Suggest and Discuss With The Other Subscribers

Subscribers can engage with each other by submitting useful articles, references, and tips with code samples via GitHub issues and initiating discussions on the repository.
